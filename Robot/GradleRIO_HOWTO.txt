HOW TO GRADLERIO:
  Note: Make sure your terminal/command prompt is in the
  same directory as the gradlew/gradlew.bat files...

  1) To run gradle, type:
    gradlew               (Windows)
    ./gradlew             (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

    Not working? Try gradlew.bat for Windows.

  2) To setup WPILib, run:
    gradlew       wpi     (Windows)
    ./gradlew     wpi     (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

  3) To setup your workspace, do the following:
    -for IntelliJ IDEA:
      gradlew     idea    (Windows)
      ./gradlew   idea    (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

      Open the .ipr file in IntelliJ, or double click to open it
    -for Eclipse:
      gradlew     eclipse (Windows)
      ./gradlew   eclipse (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

      Point your eclipse workspace to this directory

    Dependencies aren't loaded?
      Dependencies are located in ${USERHOME}/wpilib/extracted/library/
      Try adding them manually.

  4) To deploy code to the RoboRIO, do the following:
    -Check all settings in build.gradle are accurate
    -Make sure you are connected to the same network as the RIO
    -Run the following command
      gradlew     deploy  (Windows)
      ./gradlew   deploy  (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

  5) To restart robot code:
    Restarting Robot Code is to restart the user program on the RoboRIO without
    turning off the RoboRIO itself. This is handy for deploys.
    To do so, run:
      gradlew     restart  (Windows)
      ./gradlew   restart  (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

  6) To reboot the RoboRIO:
    Rebooting means to completely restart the RoboRIO, not just the code on
    it. To do so, run:
      gradlew     reboot  (Windows)
      ./gradlew   reboot  (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

  7) To clean the code on the RoboRIO:
    To clean the code on the RIO means to remove the java file already present
    on the RIO. This is useful for debugging. To do so, run:
      gradlew     cleanRIO  (Windows)
      ./gradlew   cleanRIO  (Mac/Linux/UNIX)
