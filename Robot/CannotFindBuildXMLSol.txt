Eclipse Build.xml file not found issue resolution.

If you get an error in your project: 
C:\Users\{user}\{project_location}\{project_name}\ build.xml:28: Cannot find C:\Users\{user}\{project_location}\{project_name}\ ${wpilib.ant.dir}\build.xml imported from C:\Users\{user}\{project_location}\{project_name}\ build.xml

Then there's a very simple solution. 
1) Go to File -> New -> Other
2) find Robot Java Project and select it.
	Name it anything except whatever your main project is named.
	After the project has been made, delete it. 
	
This should resolve your problem on all your projects.
