# Vision
[GRIP](https://github.com/WPIRoboticsProjects/GRIP) is a visual editor for manipulating images. It can be ran on the driver station or directly on the RoboRIO. For our purposes, it will be ran on the RoboRIO. 

The GRIP file has already been set up, it should not be edited often.

The robot has a USB camera plugged into the RoboRIO. It can be treated as a webcam. It is most likely going to be "cam0" (index 0), however this can be double-checked through the RoboRIO web interface.

There are instructions on GRIP's wiki to deploy GRIP. Deploy with the target GRIP file "project.grip".
