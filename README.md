NOTE: If you want to clone via ssh (So you don't have to enter your passwd everytime, instead of the https:// clone on the github web page, use ssh instead:

'git clone ssh://git@github.com/FIRST-Team-2557-The-SOTABots/FRC_Robot.git'

This has to be done AFTER you get the ssh-based environment set up.
