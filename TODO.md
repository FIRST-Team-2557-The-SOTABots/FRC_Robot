# To Do
This file contains a list of everything that programmers need to complete during the 2016 season. This file is to be modified as needed.

### Arm
1. Test "potentiometer speed"s on the actuators
2. Determine the max potentiometer speed
3. Set the actuators on a PID for potentiometer speed (this will raise/lower both actuators at the same rate)
4. Determine actuator potentiometer voltage [on the competition bot] for putting the hook onto the bar
5. Determine actuator potentiometer volatge [on the competition bot] for allowing the camera to see through the arm (when it's close to the floor)

### Climber
1. Reassign buttons for the winch and secondary arm release

### Autonomous
1. Test robot driving straight
2. Test distance drive [scrap & modify autos if distance estimation does not work]
3. Test Rock Wall auto
4. Test Rampards auto
5. Test Moat auto

### Automation
1. Modify the Load Ball automation [on the competition bot] to work with the new bucket
2. Attach Load Ball automation to the manipulator's gamepad
3. Automate climbing

### Vision
1. Set the Pi's IP to a static 10.25.57.11 [to hopefully have it show up on the SmartDashboard]
2. Modify current vision correction commands to use PIDs
3. Test vision tracking and determine offset from center of camera to line up robot with high goal
4. Add vision tracking to the end of all autonomous modes
5. Attach correction commands to the manipulator's gamepad [and a cancel button]
6. Create and attach command to shoot if lined up [for when we are being pushed around, the robot will shoot if they happen to push us in a correct position to shoot]

### Lidar
1. Write algorithms for looking at angles ahead of the robot
2. ... ... ...
